# Simple Linear Regression in Python

This project provides a simple and clear implementation of Linear Regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values.

We are using dataset from kaggle. - https://www.kaggle.com/code/devzohaib/simple-linear-regression/notebook

The notebook includes:

    -Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    -Training a Linear Regression model

    -Visualizing the regression line

    -Model evaluation
